A curated collection of hands-on exercises, annotated examples, and mini-projects designed to deepen your understanding of **Rust** — from ownership and borrowing to lifetimes, traits, and async programming.  
Whether you're just starting out or refining advanced concepts, this repo is structured to support **incremental learning and experimentation**.

## Goal

I created this repo to help me learn Rust to:
- Build a strong foundation in systems programming with Rust.
- Learn through doing, building that muscle memory, break things, fix them.
- Preparing myself for more advanced applications in WebAssembly, blockchain, and backend development.

## 📚 Features

- 🧠 **Core Concepts**  
  Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and move semantics explained through annotated code.

- 🧪 **Practice-Driven**  
  Unit tests, compiler-driven challenges, and small exercises that reinforce each concept.

- 🛠️ **Real-World Patterns**  
  Error handling, iterators, smart pointers, file I/O, and CLI tools.

- 🚀 **Advanced Topics**  
  Async programming, multithreading, and snippets you can adapt into real projects.
